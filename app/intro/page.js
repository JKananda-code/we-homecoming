<p className="text-lg mb-6">Kikuyu Tradition: Adult boys and girls in adulthood.</p>
In the Kikuyu tradition girls who get married are adopted by the new family as their own and if the husband would die before her, she and her children are given full right of inheritance from that homestead. The process of inheritance is a different subject that is not addressed here. Suffice it to say that daughters who marry and their children are excluded from sharing out her parents’ resources.
The situation is different for girls who remain unmarried or become single parents while still in their own homes. In this case they, and their children, become equal inheritors with own brothers.
<p className="text-lg mt-6 mb-6">Home coming ceremonies: Organized by girl children. </p>
Kikuyu community is spread out in different counties within the Central Region of Kenya. In some places like Nyer for example girl children, whatever their status, like to go back home and honor their parents for bringing them up and introduce their own children to grand parents. The name for this ceremony in Nyeri is called “Kamweretho”. In some places like Kiambu and Muranga where PCEA Church is predominant, these ceremonies are described as demonic, and they are prohibited. However, those who believe in honoring tradition alongside the Church Doctrine practice them anyway.
<p>Wanjiku Elijah’s Home Coming: On 28th June 2025</p>
<p>Based on the foregoing introduction I, Wanjiku Elijah, organized Kamweretho to honor my parents, Elijah Kimotho and Gathigia Kimotho. I have also invited all my brothers and sisters to attend the ceremony at our home in Mathira, Nyeri. I have a son, Elijah Kimotho, and together we are honoured to have you with us on this special day for us as we honor my parents and, by extension my son, Elijah Kimotho’s grand parents.
